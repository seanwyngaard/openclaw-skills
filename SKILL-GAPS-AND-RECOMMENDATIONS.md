## The Gaps

After researching 5,700+ ClawHub skills, the Claude Code ecosystem (awesome-claude-code, wshobson/commands, alirezarezvani/claude-skills, etc.), and income guides, here are the **clear gaps** - categories where money is proven but skills are weak, half-baked, or missing entirely.

---

## TIER 1: High-Impact, Build First (Each can generate $500-1,500/month)

### 1. `/freelance-proposal-engine`
**Gap**: There are project management skills and PRD generators, but NO skill that generates tailored freelance proposals for Upwork/Fiverr/Freelancer gigs.
**What it does**:
- Takes a job listing URL or pasted description
- Analyzes the client's needs, budget signals, and pain points
- Generates a tailored proposal with your portfolio highlights
- Suggests pricing based on market rates
- Tracks proposal win rates over time
**Income path**: Apply to 5-10 gigs/day with quality proposals instead of 1-2. Even a 10% hit rate at $200-500/project = $1,000-2,500/month.
**Why it doesn't exist**: Most skills focus on *doing* the work, not *winning* the work. This is the sales funnel gap.

### 2. `/seo-content-factory`
**Gap**: SEO content skills exist on ClawHub but they're rated as "half-finished experiments" per the Gainsight community review. The top-rated ones do keyword research OR article writing, not an end-to-end pipeline.
**What it does**:
- Accepts a niche/topic
- Performs keyword research (volume, difficulty, opportunity score)
- Analyzes top 10 SERP competitors for the keyword
- Generates a fully optimized article (headings, meta description, internal linking suggestions, schema markup)
- Outputs in WordPress-ready HTML or Markdown
- Batch mode: generate 3-5 articles from a keyword cluster
**Income path**: $50-200/article on freelance platforms. 3-5 articles/day = $150-1,000/day. Even at 1 article/day sold = $1,500-6,000/month.
**Why current skills fall short**: They're single-step (just writing OR just keyword research). No competitor analysis, no SERP-aware optimization, no batch processing.

### 3. `/client-project-manager`
**Gap**: Claude Code PM and Task Master exist but focus on *developer* project management. Nothing manages *freelance client relationships* end-to-end.
**What it does**:
- Track multiple client projects with deadlines, deliverables, status
- Generate weekly client update emails automatically
- Create invoices from tracked time/deliverables
- Send payment reminders
- Maintain a CRM-like client history (past projects, preferences, rates)
- Generate project completion reports
**Income path**: Not directly income-generating, but ENABLES scaling from 1-2 clients to 5-10 by removing admin overhead. Multiplier skill.
**Why it doesn't exist**: Existing tools are dev-centric (GitHub Issues, git worktrees). Freelancers need client-facing project management.

---

## TIER 2: Medium-Impact, Build Second (Each can generate $300-800/month)

### 4. `/web-scraper-as-a-service`
**Gap**: Browser automation skills exist (139 on ClawHub) but they're generic. No skill packages scraping as a *deliverable service* with client-ready output.
**What it does**:
- Takes a scraping brief (target site, data points needed, output format)
- Generates the scraper script (Python/Playwright/Puppeteer)
- Runs and tests the scraper
- Outputs clean data in client-specified format (CSV, JSON, Excel, Google Sheets)
- Handles pagination, rate limiting, proxy rotation
- Generates a "scraper documentation" PDF for the client
**Income path**: $200-2,000/project on Upwork. Web scraping is consistently in the top 10 most-requested freelance services.
**Why current skills fall short**: Existing browser skills automate *your* browsing, not create *client deliverable* scrapers.

### 5. `/landing-page-generator`
**Gap**: Web development skills exist but none specifically generate high-converting landing pages from a brief.
**What it does**:
- Takes a product/service description, target audience, and CTA
- Generates a complete landing page (HTML/CSS/JS) with:
  - Hero section with compelling headline
  - Benefits/features section
  - Social proof section (testimonials template)
  - Pricing section
  - CTA buttons
  - Mobile responsive
- Optimized for Core Web Vitals
- Optional: Tailwind CSS or vanilla CSS
**Income path**: $100-500/landing page on Fiverr. Quick turnaround = 1-2/day feasible = $3,000-15,000/month at scale.
**Why it doesn't exist**: Web dev skills focus on component development, not complete marketing assets.

### 6. `/email-sequence-builder`
**Gap**: Email marketing copy is mentioned as a "fast to monetize" skill but there's no structured skill for building complete email sequences.
**What it does**:
- Takes a business type, goal (welcome, nurture, sales, re-engagement), and audience
- Generates a complete email sequence (5-7 emails) with:
  - Subject lines (A/B variants)
  - Preview text
  - Body copy with personalization tokens
  - CTA placement
  - Send timing recommendations
- Outputs in platform-ready format (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, ActiveCampaign)
**Income path**: $200-1,000/sequence on freelance platforms. Email marketing is a $10B+ industry.

### 7. `/social-media-content-calendar`
**Gap**: Marketing skills exist (143) but none create structured, schedulable content calendars.
**What it does**:
- Takes a brand/niche, platforms (Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, TikTok), and timeframe
- Generates a full content calendar with:
  - Post copy for each platform (adapted to format/character limits)
  - Hashtag research
  - Image/video prompts for each post
  - Best posting times
  - Content mix (educational, promotional, engagement, UGC)
- Outputs as CSV (importable to Buffer, Hootsuite, Later)
**Income path**: $300-800/month per client for social media management. Ongoing retainer work.

## TIER 3: Niche but Profitable (Each can generate $200-500/month)

### 8. `/technical-doc-generator`
**Gap**: Documentation skills exist but none create *client-deliverable* technical documentation from codebases.
**What it does**:
- Scans a codebase and generates:
  - API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger format)
  - README with setup instructions
  - Architecture diagrams (Mermaid/ASCII)
  - Changelog from git history
  - Developer onboarding guide
**Income path**: $100-500/project. Many startups need docs but hate writing them.

### 9. `/resume-and-cover-letter`
**Gap**: Surprisingly absent from both ecosystems. No skill generates tailored resumes/cover letters matched to job descriptions.
**What it does**:
- Takes user's experience/skills and a job description
- Generates ATS-optimized resume tailored to the job
- Generates matching cover letter
- Highlights keyword matches and gaps
- Outputs as clean Markdown, PDF-ready HTML, or LaTeX
**Income path**: $25-100/resume on Fiverr. High volume category (always in demand).

### 10. `/competitor-analysis-report`
**Gap**: Research skills exist but none produce a structured, client-ready competitive analysis.
**What it does**:
- Takes a business/product and 3-5 competitors
- Generates a report covering:
  - Feature comparison matrix
  - Pricing analysis
  - SEO/traffic comparison (using public data)
  - Social media presence audit
  - SWOT analysis
  - Recommendations
- Outputs as professional Markdown or HTML report
**Income path**: $200-500/report. Businesses need these regularly.

### 11. `/contract-generator`
**Gap**: Finance skills (22) don't cover freelance contract generation.
**What it does**:
- Takes project scope, payment terms, timeline, parties
- Generates a professional freelance contract with:
  - Scope of work
  - Payment schedule and terms
  - IP/ownership clauses
  - Revision policy
  - Termination clause
  - Confidentiality/NDA section
- Standard templates for common project types (web dev, design, content, consulting)
**Income path**: Not directly income-generating but removes a huge friction point in closing freelance deals. Multiplier skill.

### Minimum Viable Income Stack

To hit **$1,000-2,000/month**, build skills 1-3 first:
- `/freelance-proposal-engine` wins you clients
- `/seo-content-factory` delivers the highest-demand, highest-volume service
- `/client-project-manager` lets you scale beyond 2-3 clients without dropping balls

These three together create a **complete freelance business pipeline**: win work -> deliver work -> manage clients.

---

## Dual Distribution Strategy

Every skill we build can generate income TWO ways:

1. **Use it yourself** to deliver freelance services faster (primary income)
2. **Publish to ClawHub** for $10-200/skill (passive income)

Skills that solve real problems and are well-documented sell on ClawHub. The ones that are "half-finished experiments" don't. Ours won't be.
